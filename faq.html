		<br>
		<h3>Q: I am concerned that my child is not developing normally. Can you help me? </h3>
		<p> A: We do not evaluate or diagnose children. Child Studies @ UCR is a group of laboratories that conduct basic research studies on infant and child development. If you are concerned about your child, we encourage you to contact your doctor directly. The following links may also be helpful: </p>

			</li>
		</ul>
					
		<h3>Q: I am considering letting my child participate. What would happen during the study?</h3>
		<p>A: That depends on the particular study. If your child is eligible for a study, we will call you to tell you the details about that particular study so that you can decide if your child might like to participate. Typical studies involve activities like watching videos and playing with objects. </p>
		
		<h3>Q: How long do the studies take?</h3>
		<p>A: Depending on the particular study, your visit will last between 30 and 90. </p>
		
		<h3>Q: What if my baby becomes fussy? What if my child doesn't want to participate anymore?</h3>
		<p>A: If your child becomes fussy, uncomfortable, or wants to stop for any reason we will stop the session. </p>
		
		<h3>Q: Can I bring my other children to the session?</h3>
		<p>A: Absolutely! When you are called for a study, please let the lab know if you plan to bring other children. We can provide a researcher to babysit if needed. </p>	
			
		<h3>Q: What age groups do you study?</h3>
		<p>A: We study children from birth to 12 years of age. </p>
							
		<h3>Q: Does my child get anything for participating?</h3>
		<p>A: Families typically receive $10-$20 as compensation for a visit. Infants and children will receive a small gift as a thank-you. </p>
		
		<h3>Q: Where are you located? Where can I park?</h3>
		<p>A: We are located on the UC Riverside campus. Please see our <a href="directions.html"> directions</a> page for more information. </p>
		
		<h3>Q: I'm interested in participating. What happens next?</h3>
		<p>A: First, click <a href="participate.html">here </a> to sign up. After you enter your contact information and your child's age, we will contact you about participating in studies when your child is eligible. </p>
		
		<h3>Q: Why haven't you called to schedule my child?</h3>
		<p>A: Most studies that we conduct have specific age requirements. When your child is in the age range for an ongoing study, we will contact you to ask if you are interested in having your child participate. If you don't hear from us, it just means that your child is not in the age range for any of our current studies. </p>
		
		<h3>Q: I don't want to be called anymore. Can I be taken off the list? </h3>
		<p>A: Of course! Please email us at <a href="mailto:ucrchildstudies@gmail.com"> ucrchildstudies@gmail.com </a> and let us know. We will take your name off the list so that you will not be contacted in the future. </p>
